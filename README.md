# applications of reaction wheel
Using conservation of angular momentum, the balance of a toy car is controlled by reaction-wheel or control moment gyroscopes widely used in spacecraft attitude control.

Two gyros spinning in opposite direction cancel the uneven terrain caused roll change, which translates to undesired pitch control torque. 

Major design steps are:
- Vehicle body attitude determination, embedded
- brushless motor torque control, embedded
- chassis building, solidworks mechanical design, machining
- flywheel static and dynamic balancing, mechanical
- adaptive estimate of system balance point(forward/backward), embedded
- non-contact angular position feedback, embedded
